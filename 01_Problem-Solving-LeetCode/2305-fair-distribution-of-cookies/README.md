<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fair-distribution-of-cookies/">2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>You are given an integer array <code>cookies</code>, where <code>cookies[i]</code> denotes the number of cookies in the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> bag. You are also given an integer <code>k</code> that denotes the number of children to distribute <strong>all</strong> the bags of cookies to. All the cookies in the same bag must go to the same child and cannot be split up.</p>

<p>The <strong>unfairness</strong> of a distribution is defined as the <strong>maximum</strong> <strong>total</strong> cookies obtained by a single child in the distribution.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>minimum</strong> unfairness of all distributions</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> cookies = [8,15,10,20,8], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 31
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One optimal distribution is [8,15,8] and [10,20]
- The 1<sup>st</sup> child receives [8,15,8] which has a total of 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 cookies.
- The 2<sup>nd</sup> child receives [10,20] which has a total of 10 + 20 = 30 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(31,30) = 31.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 31.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> cookies = [6,1,3,2,2,4,1,2], k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One optimal distribution is [6,1], [3,2,2], and [4,1,2]
- The 1<sup>st</sup> child receives [6,1] which has a total of 6 + 1 = 7 cookies.
- The 2<sup>nd</sup> child receives [3,2,2] which has a total of 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 cookies.
- The 3<sup>rd</sup> child receives [4,1,2] which has a total of 4 + 1 + 2 = 7 cookies.
The unfairness of the distribution is max(7,7,7) = 7.
It can be shown that there is no distribution with an unfairness less than 7.
